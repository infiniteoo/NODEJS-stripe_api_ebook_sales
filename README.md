### About

What an exciting project! This started out as another follow-along tutorial, but the techniques in the tutorial I was following were apparently depreciated and replaced with new procedures by Stripe. So, I decided to read Stripe's documentation and finish the project myself with the new procedures.

The live project is a simple E-Book store, where the user can buy a fictional web development e-book through the Stripe credit card processing payment in a test environment. After a successful purchase is made, a receipt is generated with the purchase details. I feel as if this was a huge personal success as I am growing as a developer.
